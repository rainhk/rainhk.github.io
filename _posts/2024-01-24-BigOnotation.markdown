Big O notation

# Big O notation
Big O notation describe the worst case time complexity of an algorithm.
This provides a way to express the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the growth rate of its running time concering the input size.

1. O(1)\
    \* Constant time complexity
2. O(log n)\
    \* Logarithmic time complexity. 
    \* The running time grows legarithmically as the input size increases.
3. O(n)\
    \* Linear time complexity.
    \* The running time grows linearly.
4. O(n^2)\
    \* Quadratic time complexity.
    \* The running time proportional to the square of the input size.
5. O(n!)\
    \* Factorial time complexity.
    \* The running time grows at a rate proportional to the factorial of the input size n.
6. O(2^n)\
    \* Exponential time complexity.
    \* The running time grows exponentially with the input size n.
