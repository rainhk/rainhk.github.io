Linked list or Array?

\
<br>

# Linked List
\
Items can be stored in anywhere in memory.
Each item stores the address of the next item in the list.

With Linked list, there is no need to move items.

Linked list is good for insertions.

# Array
\
Linked list is not a best list to use if you need to keep jump around items.\
It is good if you are getting all the items in the list.
\
\
But an array is different.\
You won't know addresses of the items in list for the linked list.\
But you will know addresses of the items in the array.\
\
Lists start from 0. Then for the array, what would be the address of 4th item in array of 5?\
\
The address or index will be '3'.

## Inserting into the middle of a list

**Linked list**\
It is pretty easy with linked list.\
All you need to do is just changing what previous element points to..

**Array**\
If there is no available space or memory, you might need to copy everything to a new location that can fit with a new item.
